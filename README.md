# 🐷🥘 MhooJuum Game
The MhooJuum project is a game developed using Vue.js, where players must hit appearing objects within a time limit to earn points. The game consists of several holes where moles randomly pop up, and players must react quickly to hit them by clicking on them before they disappear, and try to avoid clicking on the bomb.
